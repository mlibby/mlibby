        h2 Hello!
        p.
          I am Michael C. Libby and this is my site. I am a software developer, web developer, and constantly learning
          more about computers and programming them. My friends tend to call me &ldquo;Libby.&rdquo; You are welcome to
          do the same.
        
        p.
          If you look around here, you'll find some samples of work I've done for fun. My current favorite is a 
          #[a(href="/oregon") re-creation of the original Oregon Trail game] &mdash; a real trip down memory lane.
          I've also been working on #[a(href="/ai") learning artificial intelligence]. So I've got some exercises
          I did on that.

        h2 PiggyBank
        p. 
          My primary project right now is #[a(href="https://piggybank.live") PiggyBank] &mdash; a project to create
          a household financial appliance.

        p.
          Traditional accounting software is either single-user (not good for families and groups) or “in the cloud” 
          (i.e. your data on someone else’s computer).

        p. 
          PiggyBank is an appliance that resolves this conflict by hosting accounting software you use through your 
          web browser on a device in your house. Your data stays safe at home. You decide who can use the appliance, 
          and how, and the appliance itself is a cute little piggybank with a small computer screen in it so that you 
          can get a quick visual on how you are doing!

        h2 Unsupported Browser?
        p.
          It's possible that some of the example applications on this web site are not compatible with your web browser. If you are
          using an outdated browser like Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, then I'd suggest using Firefox, Edge,
          or even Chrome. If you are using a text-mode browser, I'm sorry, but this site is all about Javascript code which
          doesn't work in any text-mode browsers I'm aware of.
