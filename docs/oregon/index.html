<h2>Play the <em>Original</em> Oregon Trail Game</h2>
<blockquote>
<span class='icon-quotes-left mr-2'></span>
<span class='italics'>You have died of dysentery.</span>
</blockquote>
<p>
The quote above from the game Oregon Trail is an internet meme
at this point... but did you know it wasn&apos;t in the original game? The first version of Oregon Trail
was a text-only adventure written for a timeshare computer that students would interact with at a teletype
terminal. It was this version that I first encountered. I have been wanting to see it again for some time now.
</p>
<p>
This is my attempt to re-create that original version of &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;.
There are no graphics. Whenever the computer has printed out its part, you will get an
input box for your response. Just type into it and press Enter/Return. If the program is
expecting a number, you will only be able to type numbers into the box.
</p>
<p>
Please enjoy! If you are interested, here is #[a(href='/oregon/why-and-how') an essay with more background on why and how]
I put this together.
