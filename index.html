        <h2>Play the Original Oregon Trail Game</h2>
        <p>
          When I was first introduced to computers, the computer was the size of a room and was located across town from school.
          So to use the computer we sat at a teletype (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33">read more</a>).
          There was no "monitor" or "screen", it was basically a typewriter with a really long roll of paper. First you would dial
          a phone, put the phone in this contraption, and then once the teletype was communicating with the computer, you were
          "online"... Once you were connected then the computer would type some stuff, you would type some stuff, then the computer
          would type some more stuff, and on it went. When you were done, you just hung up the phone, tore off your long piece of 
          paper, rolled it up, and went home.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was on a system like this that I first played the game "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(1971_video_game)">The Oregon Trail</a>" by 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MECC">MECC</a> (fun note: I later got a high school job at MECC doing desktop
          publishing and technical writing). But Oregon Trail was my first serious computer encounter, I loved the game and I
          even printed out the BASIC code for the game to see how it worked.

          The Oregon Trail is a classic computer game, but most people my age were first introduced to it in a later version that
          was produced for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a>. There were two versions that came out in the 80's,
          one started introducing more graphics, and the second was much more graphical in presentation. If you are nostalgic for that version,
          it's pretty easy to find an Apple II emulator and the disk image for the Oregon Trail game. Heck, you can buy a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/The-Oregon-Trail-Handheld-Game/dp/B07B61BFSW/">handheld gadget</a>
          in stores that has an early version of the game on it.

          But, for me, that just wasn't the same. It wasn't how <em>I</em> remembered the game! After looking I still haven't found a 
          decent online emulator where I could play the real original version of Oregon Trail. But I was able to find some
