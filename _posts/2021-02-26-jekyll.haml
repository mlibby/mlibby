title: "In Progress: Switching to Jekyll"

%p
  I've finally gotten around to putting this site on Jekyll. Well, almost.
%p
  It's a work in progress. I am dumping the Bootstrap framework for styling and layout, so 
  I do need to update some styles and layouts around the site. And not all of the old pages
  have been converted yet.
